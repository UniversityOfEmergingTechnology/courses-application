# Course Filter - API Integration & Conditional Rendering

## Description
Course Filter is a React application that fetches data from an API and allows users to filter courses based on various criteria. It's an excellent project for understanding API integration, conditional rendering, and complex state management in React.

## Features
- **API Integration**: Fetch and display a list of courses from an external API.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Render courses based on selected filters.
- **Complex State Management**: Manage states that reflect user selections and API responses.
- **User Interaction**: Filter courses based on criteria like category, level, or instructor.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UniversityOfEmergingTechnology/courses-application.git
cd course-filter
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage
After launching the app, use the filters to narrow down the list of courses. Explore how data fetched from an API can be rendered conditionally based on user input.
